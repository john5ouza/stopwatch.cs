**Introduction**
This repository contains a basic yet effective C# program designed as a stopwatch, aptly named "STOPWATC#". The application allows users to set a timer, either in seconds or minutes, and it will count up to the specified time. The timer is designed to be straightforward and user-friendly.

## Code Organization
The code has been meticulously structured into specific methods to foster readability and ease of maintenance:

1. **Menu()**:
   This method serves as the main interface of the stopwatch. It guides users through setting their desired time in either seconds or minutes and even provides an option to exit the application.

2. **PreStart(int time)**:
   A preparatory phase before the actual countdown. It displays a brief "Ready... Go!" prompt before initiating the timer.

3. **Start(int time)**:
   The heart of the application. This method takes the specified time (converted to seconds) and counts up, updating the display every second until the set time is reached.

4. **Main(string[] args)**:
   The main method simply initiates the program by calling the `Menu()` method.

## Future Improvements
It's important to note that this code is scheduled for refactoring in the foreseeable future. This will be done to enhance its efficiency, user interface, and perhaps introduce more advanced functionalities based on user feedback.

## How to Use
To make use of this stopwatch:

- Clone the repository onto your machine.
- Navigate to the directory containing the C# file in your terminal or command prompt.
- If you have the .NET SDK installed, use the command `dotnet run <filename>.cs` to execute the program.

Upon launching, you'll be presented with the stopwatch's menu. Input the desired countdown duration following the format guidelines (e.g., 10s for 10 seconds or 2m for 2 minutes).

## Feedback and Contributions
This C# stopwatch aims to provide a basic timing tool, and we are eager to make it better with your help. Suggestions, concerns, or improvements are always welcome. Please feel free to raise issues or contribute via pull requests.
